# Cast Jitsi meetings to a TV

## Overview

Support casting a meeting to a TV or Chromecast connected screen so the meeting can be used there instead of on the
device screen.

## Description

There are occasions where having the meeting display on a larger screen could be very useful, like in a physical meeting
room. Adding the ability of casting a meeting would allow a simple and wireless way for taking the meeting experience to
a large screen, while keeping the camera and microphone in the local device.

## Expected outcomes

A new "cast this meeting" feature.

## Skills

saghul, hristoterezov, jallamsetty1.
