# Picture-in-Picture support for Jitsi Meet on iOS

## Overview

Make it possible to see a reduced version of the meeting (just the active speaker) when going into the background.

## Description

While iOS does have support for picture-in-picture, in practice it's quite limited because it only works for videos.
However, it should be possible to "produce" a video on the fly so we can have PiP working on iOS!

## Expected outcomes

A working PiP implementation for iOS.

## Skills

ObjC/ Swift / React Native / iOS development / WerRTC (recommended).

## Possible mentors

saghul, alexbumbu.

## Expected project size

350 hours.

## Difficulty

Hard.
